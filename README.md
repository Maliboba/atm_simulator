# 🏧 ATM Simulator in Python

This project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator built in Python. It's a command-line application that allows a user to perform basic banking operations like checking their balance, depositing and withdrawing money, and viewing their transaction history.

## ✨ Features

The simulator includes the following functionalities:

* **User Authentication**: A simple PIN-based login system that grants access to the main menu.

* **Main Menu**: A clear, interactive menu with options for all the core functions.

* **Check Balance**: Displays the user's current account balance.

* **Deposit Money**: Allows the user to add funds to their account, with validation to prevent negative or zero deposits.

* **Withdraw Money**: Allows the user to take out money, with checks for sufficient funds and a daily withdrawal limit.

* **Transaction History**: Keeps a detailed record of all transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for the current session.

* **Receipt Generator**: Prints a simple receipt after each successful deposit or withdrawal, showing the transaction details.
